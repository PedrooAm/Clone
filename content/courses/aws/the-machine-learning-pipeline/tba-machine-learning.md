##### About the Course

This course explores how to use the machine learning (ML) pipeline to solve a real business problem in a project-based learning environment. Students will learn about each phase of the pipeline from instructor presentations and demonstrations and then apply that knowledge to complete a project solving one of three business problems: fraud detection, recommendation engines, or flight delays. By the end of the course, students will have successfully built, trained, evaluated, tuned, and deployed an ML model using Amazon SageMaker that solves their selected business problem.

#### Course Price 

* Virtual campaign price EUR 2,790.00 (excl VAT)
* Regular price EUR 3,290.00 (excl VAT)

#### Language

The course will be taught in English.

#### This course is intended for:

* Developers

* Basic knowledge of Python programming language
* Basic understanding of AWS Cloud infrastructure (Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudWatch)
* Basic experience working in a Jupyter notebook environment

#### This course is designed to teach you how to:

* Select and justify the appropriate ML approach for a given business problem
* Use the ML pipeline to solve a specific business problem
Train, evaluate, deploy, and tune an ML model using Amazon SageMaker
* Describe some of the best practices for designing scalable, cost-optimized, and secure ML pipelines in AWS
* Apply machine learning to a real-life business problem after the course is complete
