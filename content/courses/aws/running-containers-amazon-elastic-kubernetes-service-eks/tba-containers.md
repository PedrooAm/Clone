##### About the Course

You will build an Amazon EKS cluster, configure the environment, deploy the cluster, and then add applications to your cluster. You will manage container images using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and learn how to automate application deployment. You will deploy applications using CI/CD tools. You will learn how to monitor and scale your environment by using metrics, logging, tracing, and horizontal/vertical scaling. You will learn how to design and manage a large container environment by designing for efficiency, cost, and resiliency. You will configure AWS networking services to support the cluster and learn how to secure your Amazon EKS environment.

#### Course Price 

* Virtual campaign price EUR 2,140.00 (excl VAT)
* Regular price EUR 2,490.00 (excl VAT)

#### Language

Luennot ovat suomeksi, mikäli kaikki osallistujat osaavat suomea. Lectures are in English if someone doesn’t understand Finnish.

#### This course is intended for:

* DevOps engineers
* Systems administrators

#### Course Prerequisites

* Completed Introduction to Containers
* Completed Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Primer
* Completed AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (or equivalent real-world experience)
* Basic Linux administration experience
* Basic network administration experience
* Basic knowledge of containers and microservices

#### This course is designed to teach you how to:

* Describe Kubernetes and Amazon EKS fundamentals and the impact of containers on workflows.
* Build an Amazon EKS cluster by selecting the correct compute resources to support worker nodes.
* Secure your environment with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication and Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization.
* Deploy an application on the cluster. Publish container images to Amazon ECR and secure access via IAM policy
* Deploy applications using automated tools and pipelines. Create a GitOps pipeline using WeaveFlux.
* Collect monitoring data through metrics, logs, and tracing with AWS X-Ray and identify metrics for performance tuning. Review scenarios where bottlenecks require the best scaling approach using horizontal or vertical scaling.
* Assess the tradeoffs between efficiency, resiliency, and cost and the impact of tuning for one over the others. Describe and outline a holistic, iterative approach to optimizing your environment. Design for cost, efficiency, and resiliency.
* Configure AWS networking services to support the cluster. Describe how Amazon Virtual * Private Cloud (VPC) supports Amazon EKS clusters and simplifies inter-node communications. Describe the function of the VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). Review the benefits of a service mesh
* Upgrade your Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, and third party tools.
