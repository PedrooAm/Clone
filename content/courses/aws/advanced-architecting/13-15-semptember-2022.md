#### Prerequisites

* Attended the Architecting on AWS course
* or Achieved the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification
* Knowledge and experience with core AWS services from the Compute, Storage, Networking, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) categories

#### This course is designed to teach you how to:

* Review the AWS Well-Architected Framework to ensure understanding of best cloud design practices by responding to poll questions while following a graphic presentation
* Demonstrate the ability to secure Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint connections in a lab environment
* Identify how to implement centralized permissions management and reduce risk using AWS Organizations organizational units (OUs) and service control policies (SCPs) with AWS Single SignOn
* Compare the permissions management capabilities of OUs, SCPs, and AWS SSO with and without AWS Control Tower to determine best practices based on use cases
* Discuss AWS hybrid network designs to address traffic increases and streamline remote work while ensuring FIPS 140-2 Level 2, or Level 3 security compliance
* Explore the solutions and products available to design a hybrid infrastructure, including access to 5G networks, to optimize service and reduce latency while maintaining high security for critical onpremises applications
* Explore ways to simplify the connection configurations between applications and highperformance workloads across global networks
* Demonstrate the ability to configure a transit gateway in a lab environment
* Identify and discuss container solutions and define container management options
* Build and test a container in a lab environment
* Examine how the AWS developer tools optimize the CI/CD pipeline with updates based on near real-time data
* Identify the anomaly detection and protection services that AWS offers to defend against DDoS attacks
* Identify ways to secure data in transit, at rest, and in use with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and AWS Secrets Manager
* Determine the best data management solution based on frequency of access, and data query and analysis needs
* Set up a data lake and examine the advantages of this type of storage configuration to crawl and query data in a lab environment
* Identify solutions to optimize edge services to eliminate latency, reduce inefficiencies, and mitigate risks
* Identify the components used to automate the scaling of global applications using geolocation and traffic control
* Deploy and activate an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway and AWS DataSync in a lab environment
* Review AWS cost management tools to optimize costs while ensuring speed and performance
* Review migration tools, services, and processes that AWS provides to implement effective cloud operation models based on use cases and business needs
