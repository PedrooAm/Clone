##### About the Course

Deep Learning on AWS is a one-day course that introduces you to cloud-based Deep Learning (DL) solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The training will detail how deep learning is useful and explain its different concepts. This course also teaches you how to run your models on the cloud using Amazon SageMaker and MXNet framework. In addition, you will gain a better understanding deploying your deep learning models using AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) while designing intelligent systems on AWS, based on Deep Learning.

#### Course Price 

* Virtual campaign price EUR 870.00 (excl VAT)
* Regular price EUR 890.00 (excl VAT

#### Language

The course will be taught in English.
