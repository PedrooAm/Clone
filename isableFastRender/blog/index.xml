      <description>Let’s admit it. We access more and more of the information we need in our daily activities using URLs. These URLs have become longer and more cryptic over time but that’s ok since we simply click on them.

I want the class to download a piece of source code, but the GitHub project file URL is way too long to be correctly retyped by the attendees.</description>
